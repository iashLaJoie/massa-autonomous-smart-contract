the ASC functionalities here solely rely on async messaging that is all.

the deffered calls functionalities that makes this way better, like having a quote of usage, choosing the cheapest slot and actually choosing exactly the slot and time you want for the future execution is 
not documented yet not even the functions you can use (massa as sdk in the documentation doesn't have the new functions for deffered calls)

maybe the best source rightnow to kind of have a foggy understanding of deffered calls is this repo:
